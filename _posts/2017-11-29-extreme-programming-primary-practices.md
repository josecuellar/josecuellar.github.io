The XP practices do not represent some kind of pinnacle in the evolution of software development. They are a common way station on the road to improvement. The primary practices are useful independent of what else you are doing. They each can give you immediate improvement. You can start safely with any of them. The corollary practices are likely to be difficult without first mastering the primary practices. The amplification effect of using the practices together means there is an advantage to adding practices as quickly as you can. ![](https://josecuellar.net/wp-content/uploads/xpPrimaryPractices.png) [<span aria-label="Sigue leyendo Extreme programming.
